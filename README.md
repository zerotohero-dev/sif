`sif` is an intelligent curator that makes information meaningful and findable.

> `sif` is not a search engine; it's different.

The only way to see how different it is, is through actually using it.

I've been privately using a bunch of shell scripts for a similar purpose;
and now I decided to make it more usable.

## Usage Examples

TODO:// to be updated.

## The Index

`sif` has a large sample data that you can use out-of-the box if you want to.
I regularly update the data set; and you are welcome to suggest additional links
too.

The initial data you see when you install `sif`, will be my original 
(and growing) working set; however you are more than welcome to PR and add 
additional links to it.

TODO:// explain process of how to suggest link.
TODO:// add ability to fetch recent data set (from github)

## The Backstory

I touch a substantial amount of links while I'm doing my day-to-day work. 
I collect, categorize, and sift links.

After figuring out that it becomes damn hard to search your bookmarks after your 
browser's bookmark index grows above tens of megabytes, I decided to create a
command-line utility that will help me sift through data efficiently 
and effectively.

Although there are websites for this purpose, they are slow to respond, and the
are slower to use than a terminal. --- command line FTW!
